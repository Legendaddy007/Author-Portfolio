      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        I’m Karthik Chyawan—writer, poet, storyteller, and a hopeless romantic
        when it comes to the written word. By day, I wrestle with logic and
        systems in the world of Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity. But by night?
        Ah, that’s when I escape into the rhythm of language, where emotions
        spill onto the page, raw and unfiltered. My debut book, Your Lie in
        July, wasn’t just something I wrote—it was something I lived. A
        long-distance love story told through prose poetry, it’s a memoir of
        hearts reaching across miles, stitched together by longing and the kind
        of love that changes you. And the journey doesn’t end there—Graveyard of
        Us is coming, because some stories don’t fit neatly into a single book.
        I write because I believe in the power of words to heal, to connect, to
        remind us that we are not alone. If even one person reads my work and
        sees themselves in it—feels a little less lost, a little more
        understood—then I’ve done what I was meant to do. Because in the end,
        isn’t that what stories are for? And no matter what world tells you,
        words and ideas can change the world.

      <!-- First Book-->
      <div class="book">
        <img src="YLIJ.png" alt="Your Lie in July" />
        <p style="text-align: left">Your Lie in July - Your Lie in July is a poetic memoir that explores the intoxicating highs of love, the soul-crushing depths of loss, and the painful yet beautiful journey of self-reclamation. Through a fusion of prose and poetry, Karthik Chyawan paints a platonic portrait of a love that arrived like a summer storm—fierce, unexpected, and transformative—only to fade into a hushed ache.
            Structured as a collection of lyrical reflections, the book captures the raw intensity of a long-distance love story that changed everything. With breathtaking vulnerability, Karthik navigates the moments of passion, heartbreak, and the silence left behind. Each piece, whether in verse or poetic prose, serves as a window into the emotional turmoil of longing, unspoken goodbyes, and the inevitable realization that some love stories are not meant to last—but they leave an everlasting imprint.
            Unlike conventional narratives of healing, Your Lie in July does not seek to mend the wounds of love but rather honors them. It is a tribute to the kind of love that shapes us, breaks us, and ultimately teaches us who we are. Through evocative imagery, metaphor, and deeply personal storytelling, this book speaks to anyone who has ever lost themselves in love and had to find their way back.
            Perfect for readers who appreciate literary memoirs, lyrical storytelling, and raw emotional truth, Your Lie in July is an unforgettable journey through love’s wilderness—a book that lingers in the soul long after the final page.

      <p style="text-align: left">
          <strong>Letters I Wrote to the Winter Sun</strong> - You ever love someone so much that your heart just aches in a way that’s not quite pain but something deeper—something like standing in the middle of a Van Gogh painting, arms wide open, knowing you’ll never step beyond the frame? That’s what this is. Letters I Wrote to the Winter Sun isn’t just a book; it’s a conversation with the silence, a love letter scribbled in the margins of time, pressed between the pages of longing and surrender.

          Our narrator? A man who loves without permission, without expectation, without the comfort of return. He writes—not to be read, not to be answered, but because some loves only exist when they’re put to words. These letters are confessions never spoken aloud, echoes of a heart that beats in poetry, in metaphors, in the quiet tragedy of a love that burns so fiercely, it must be hidden from the world.
          
          This is not a love story. Oh no, love stories have resolutions, and this has none. This is a requiem, a song hummed under the breath for something that was—perhaps—a fleeting moment, or maybe something that never was at all. It’s a book for the ones who’ve held a name on their tongue but never dared to speak it. For those who’ve looked at someone and thought, My God, there goes my undoing.
          
          There is beauty here, in the ache, in the distance, in the letters never sent. Because some loves aren’t meant to be held—they’re meant to be written, to be whispered into the wind, to be carried like a secret between the sun and the moon. And even as the sun sets, even as the pages close, the love remains. Always.

            <b>"The Sinking Lighthouse"</b>

            Far in the folds of the restless sea,
            There it stands, among a herd of trees.
            A sentinel against the grim abyss,
            Neither defiant nor resigned,
            Where time narrates its wordless rhymes,
            A lighthouse dressed in dust and vines.
            
            Amid the endless ocean’s sway,
            It stood unbothered through night and day,
            Its stones bear scars of years gone by,
            Under burning suns and tempest skies.
            A rusty knight who's mossy skinned,
            Kissed and scarred by salty winds.
            Its light, a guide for hearts astray,
            A shelter to the feeble castaways.
            
            Encircled by ships on fleeting quests,
            Their journeys painted fleeting guests,
            It watched the seasons shift and play,
            While time, unkind, wore stones away.
            Around it churned the capricious sea,
            Blissfully wild and boundlessly free.
            
            In springtime’s blush, the island woke,
            Winds carrying scents of earth and oak.
            The leaves would hum and sing on trees, 
            The clouds passing by, a moment of peace.
            The waves roll softly to cuddle the shore,
            And the sailors dream of home once more.
            
            As summer’s breath began to swell,
            The lighthouse stood through a heated spell.
            The winds grew heavy, the sun burned bright,
            Casting shadows long into the night.
            The waves, once soft, now rose with might,
            And ships sailed on in the blinding light.
            The isle bathed in golden hues,
            And the ocean shimmers, vast and blue.
            
            Now Autumn draped its fiery gown,
            As tempests roared and leaves fell down.
            The woods, painted in shades of flame, 
            The trees stood bare, naked with shame.
            While leaves descended like a shroud,
            The seas grew wild, their voices loud.
            The air grew crisp and as wind rustled high,
            The clouds would gather, darkening the sky.
            The ships that passed were few, yet wise.
            Sailing beneath the amber skies.
            The lighthouse flickered in the glow,
            A silent witness to the falling show.
            
            Winters crept with a spectral grace,
            Veiling the isle, a glazy embrace.
            Frosted silence in frozen veins,
            Snow crowned the tower, 
            vines became icy chains.
            No ships to hail, no souls to see,
            Just endless dark and cimmerian sea.
            The winds grew sharp, their whispers stern,
            While skies turned pale, too cold to burn.
            Frost laced the trees, a silver guise,
            As waves fell mute beneath leaden skies.
            Brumal squalls played the lonesome lute,
            The lighthouse, cloaked in a somber mood.
            It nearly sneezed "What a somnolent December!"
            It sighed "I'm about to fall into slumber!".
            Its light, a pulse both faint and slow,
            Flickered beneath the icebound glow.
            The lighthouse dreamed in its solemn rest,
            Of ships long gone and stormy guests.
            The woods were hushed, their songs withdrawn,
            Buried beneath the snow-white gown.
            Dead silence stretched from shore to shore,
            The tower hibernated with soundless snores.
            
            But deep below, the earth conspired,
            A molten heart with fury fired,
            The island quaked, its fate untied,
            An ancient tremor stirred inside.
            The earthly brew made the snowscape quake,
            The island groaned with that fatal ache.
            The woods bowed low, the earth gave way,
            The waves grew bold, the skies -- charcoal-grey,
            The lighthouse stood, its light grew bright,
            Defying the chaos of the ghastly night.
            
            A ship appeared, its sails undone,
            A final guest before the sun.
            The beacon smiled, a guiding hand,
            A farewell gift to the sea and land.
            The waters rose, the island sank,
            Its edges crumbled, its forests blank,
            The tower leaned, then slipped below,
            Into the depths where shadows grow.
            
            When dawn unveiled the endless blue,
            No trace remained of what was true,
            The isle and tower, lost to time,
            A tale now told in mournful rhyme.
            Yet sailors swear on moonlit tides,
            A phantom light still softly guides,
            A tender glow through fog and spray,
            The sinking lighthouse leads the way.

        <pre style="text-align: center;">
          <b>"Lily of the Valley"</b>

            A salubrious sight to the sore eyes, 
            A humbly meek evening it was,
            Upon a hillside bathed in the fleeting shades of spring, 
            An evening unfolds like the greatest story left untold.
            I wandered right into it when
            the air brushed its peculiarly gentle fingers,
            through my hair quite like my mother used to,
            My breath ; slow and heavy,
            Like the world was caught between sighs.
            The sky unraveled above me,
            The mystical canvas where plum bled into indigo,
            and streaks of amber clung stubbornly
            to the edges of vanishing light.
            
            The sun, weary from its journey across the welkin,
            sank lower, its gold-lacquered arms melting into the vault of heaven,
            rendering it awash with violets and purples, 
            hues so rich they seemed conjured from a painter’s secret palette. 
            Beneath my feet, the ground softened,
            An arabesque of moss stitched with fern fronds,
            their silken viridescent glistening
            with pearls of dew that the sun had forgotten.
            The zephyr carried faint secrets—
            the resinous tang of pine,
            the beguiling sweetness of wildflowers
            and the quiet hum of a thousand flowers,
            their petals flapped like pages of an ancient tome, 
            roused by an unseen hand.
            
            The earth wore a crown of blossoms, wild, untamed, and untouched, 
            scattered as though spilled by a careless gust. 
            Each one glowed faintly in the vesper's lap, 
            catching the last lazy beams of the retreating sun. 
            Below, the valley murmured with the distant song,
            of a brook winding its way through mossy stones, 
            its voice mingling with the faint calls of lovesick birds.
            The sky, its eyelids heavy with impending dusk,
            a tapestry where the remnants of the daylight and 
            the shadows of night waged a gentle, harmonious war. 
            Stars began winking shyly at the earth, 
            their light barely piercing the deepening purple.
            An eerie sight to behold, 
            the kind that lives only in moments,
            too fleeting to hold, 
            where the time slows to a fragmented breath, 
            And waiting, as if daring you to look away 
            and miss the miracle before you.
            
            And there, amidst nature's alchemy,
            a singular grace stood,
            a lily of the valley,
            its bell-like blooms bowed
            in humble reverence to the dusk.
            its slender stem, a poised defiance
            against the gathering shadows.
            their white so pure it seemed 
            borrowed from moonlight yet unseen.
            I knelt as though before a shrine,
            The petals curved inward,
            like folded hands guarding
            a secret unknown.
            
            I spoke my heart out,
            words tumbling out like leaves
            released by the wind.
            I told it about my search for something whole,
            something untouched by the ache I carried,
            that had followed me for so long.
            The flower swayed,
            its movements answering in a language
            I could feel but never name.
            
            Night folded itself around me, 
            the stars uncurled—
            tiny beacons strung like pearls
            on the velvet neck of the sky.
            The air grew cooler,
            the hillside settling onto the arms of darkness,
            and I rested beside the flower,
            its faint, sweet scent,
            a lullaby to my tired senses.
            
            And when dawn broke,
            I woke to a tender golden embrace—
            sunrays kissing the petals,
            turning them translucent,
            each bell aglow like a tiny lantern,
            guiding my gaze to wonder.
            It stood unchanged,
            yet more alive,
            as if the sun had gifted it
            a voice I could not hear
            but could only feel
            in the marrow of my being.
            
            The hillside seemed brighter now,
            the world, brimming with life,
            in its intrinsic stillness.
            I stood beside the lily for a while longer,
            letting the sun’s warmth seep into my skin,
            letting the silence fill the cracks in my soul.
            And I turned, taking a final, lingering glance,
            my steps, reluctant yet resolute,
            And I carried with me the silent hymn of the hillside.

          <b>"Blue-Blooded"</b>

          My past's an armor
          I cannot take it off.
          No matter how much
          I'm told
          I'm done with the war.
          It's gotten fragile though,
          It's like it's paper thin.
          So just be careful
          I'm not as strong as I may seem.
          
          I shut my eyelids,
          That's when it all comes back. 
          I'm in the woods now,
          I look around and see. 
          My senses, freezing.
          the mist doesn't let me see.
          Sitting against an old familiar tree,
          The tree's bleeding blue,
          from its trunk seamlessly.
          Its canopy, ashen gray.
          Its roots, they writhe,
          like veins under pale skin,
          twisting and turning,
          quite like we hide our sins.
          The air feels heavy,
          like a weight upon my chest,
          each breath a whisper,
          in this woodland unrest.
          I hear,
          A rustle behind me.
          I see, 
          shadows surround me.
          But they don't move now, 
          They stand still, eyeing me.
          They don't speak, 
          but I hear it still,
          a murmur of sorrows,
          Shivering with chills.
          
          The tree's blue blood glistens,
          like tears caught mid-fall.
          I reach for the bark,
          it felt somewhat warm,
          Yet somehow cold.
          The roots quiver beneath me,
          a pulse within the ground,
          as if the tree itself
          could feel my heart's each pound.
          "What's happened to you?"
          I whisper with concern.
          "Your wounds run deep,
          your veins, they spill sky’s hue.
          How long have you stood here,
          Majestically broken but astoundingly true?"
          Its canopy sighs,
          a brittle, cracked plea,
          and for a moment,
          it feels like it sees me.
          "I don't know how to help you,"
          I confessingly say.
          "but I know this ache,
          this burden, this woe.
          You're weathered and worn,
          yet you still stand tall,
          but I wonder, for how long,
          before you finally fall?"
          
          The woods grow silent,
          save the wind's eerie hum,
          when from deep within the tree,
          a voice softly comes.
          "Do you not see, wanderer,
          as you stare at my scar?
          The cracks that you pity
          are a mirror of what you are."
          
          I step back, startled,
          its words sink deep,
          "My bleeding?" I murmur,
          "Is it truly there?"
          The tree’s branches groan,
          a nod through the air.
          
          Its words sink in,
          while I feel torn in two.
          A single tear escapes me,
          and mingles with the blue.
          
          The mist grows thicker,
          the woods fade away.
          The tree's voice lingers,
          its echoes softly stay 
          "Carry your armor,
          but let your roots breathe.
          Scars tell your story,
          but don't let them seethe."
          A chill runs through me,
          the weight starts to shift.
          The woods dissolve,
          like a fleeting mist.
          Catching my breath—
          I'm awake once more.
          The cold of reality
          seeps through my core.

          <b>"Hazel Eyes"</b>

          Those summer nights, the moon in sight
          I wove constellations, turned into rhymes.
          A pen for a lance, I’m a fallen knight,
          Fell for a star, that wasn’t mine.
          
          The perfect place, the perfect time,
          To commit such a lovely crime.
          A starry ride through ebony skies,
          Brisker, just the way time flies.
          
          Through the fields of lavender,
          I venture out on my own.
          I hear whispers as I wander,
          An owl dubbing me lovelorn.
          
          The moon slips past the mare’s livid skin,
          As it gallops on the edge of something blue.
          And there I sparred with the rolling winds,
          I might go down in history: or maybe something new.
          
          Fend off the winds, I reach a brink.
          From what I see, my dolors shrink.
          A star came down: a silhouette of hers.
          Two hazel eyes against the whole universe.
          
          Was I lost or found? I couldn’t figure it out.
          It took a while when I snapped out.
          Two blinks, four steps, I was off the brink.
          I went down in history, as I fell there in.

          <b>"Where the Shadow Ends"</b>

          My skies were veiled with cimmerian shade,
          Facing blustery winds, I stood unswayed.
          Bones of dreamy ships lying on the ocean floor.
          My hopeless heart was left on the lonely shore.
          
          On the verge of the valley of broken dreams I stood,
          Decided to take a leap of faith as someday every soul has to thaw.
          And dived down into the unknown depths.
          Carcasses of unfulfilled hopes and unanswered prayers, was all I saw.
          
          Kept following the depths, the darkness didn't let me see through,
          Out of the blue, my demons ambushed me.
          A selenic muliebral shadow caught my eye,
          Her aura lightened up the obsidian sea.
          
          She silenced my demons and led me to a seraphic view,
          Her hands in mine, like on a leaf rests the morning dew.
          She told me in a dulcet tone "I'll meet you where the shadow ends."
          "Where the dawn breaks and the light ascends."
          
          Crossing the badlands, looking for dawn.
          Facing the roaring storms head on.
          Through the broken gates of kingdom come,
          My heart enlivened to see what stood in front!
          
          I could see her as a lighthouse through the smoke,
          The breeze played a welcoming symphony.
          At last, from that dreadful nightmare I awoke,
          She gave me the heaven in her company.

          <b>"Sanguine Rose"</b>

          I recall of the breathless whispers,
          Of nights cocooned in abysmal melancholy.
          I used to cry out loud, silent were the tears.
          Life was like a sad song narrating a sob story.
          
          A day came when a sanguine rose,
          Tasselled out of my impoverished terrain.
          I placed it in my vase of aching love,
          Aromatizing my cloudland, it syphoned all of my pain.
          
          That sweetest smile, the seraphic gaze.
          That vehemency pulled my soul into a sentimental whirlpool.
          Over and over I fell for it in million ways.
          Now, I treasure it as an ambrosial jewel.
          
          Stardust settles in the eye-lashes,
          Dreamy fancies veil my mind.
          In the mirror of my eyes, that artistry flashes.
          With a fine tooth comb, By God's hand, that being was designed.
          
          Those velvet petals as if kissed by the crimson moonlight,
          Butterflies dance on the fringes.
          The beauty it holds is my kryptonite,
          Encircled with love, I'm standing on the inches.

          In the middle of the night, a blustery wind howled.
          I was on the rooftop, At me, the wind scowled.
          Like a wolf, marks its claim to the night.
          The wind blew harder, showing me its might. 
          
          
          The trees waver and bow to its wrath,
          They're well aware of the aftermath.
          Wind gushed through the woods creating a sombre melody,
          Turns into an orchestra, when rustling leaves join the parody.
          
          Baleful thunder rumbles through the clouds,
          Yodelling the ballad of the rain aloud.
          To me, its a hymn to the forsaken days,
          Falling prey to my memories, I'm held, hostage.
          
          The rain crashes down in a startling way,
          My heartbeat trembles and my feet shake.
          As the pain within me outpours, my soul repines.
          With cold drops of the rain, my tears intertwine.
          
          It's been a coon's age since my eyes ran dry.
          Half of my bulk were the tears I was holding,
          Never had an idea, I'll be thankful to the skies.
          It finally feels light, within the chest what I'm bearing.

          <b>"Odyssey of Raindrops"</b>

          High up in the deep blue yonder,
          In the wombs of some pregnant clouds,
          Pellucid drops of rain come to life.
          
          In their honour, the thunder rumbles.
          The leaden skies tremble euphorically.
          
          A silent freefall,
          Fearless dive,
          Piercing through
          Layers of time,
          An unknown depth,
          To the farthest distance.
          
          They collide,
          Merge,
          Dissolve,
          Evolve.
          Each holding its own fate,
          On a path of aimless wanderings.
          
          Pushing their way,
          Through the grey skies.
          Passing birds that,
          Fly amazingly high.
          
          Earth resonates with joy,
          Paying homage to the rain.
          Breeze playing entrancing symphonies,
          Lush virdescent groves,
          Bow welcomingly.
          
          That bewitching view,
          Of ravishing glory.
          I'm engraving down,
          On parched paper.
          
          Inner peace exhumed,
          By the celestial brew.
          Inviting the wind,
          To comb my soul.
          Bathe my sinful body,
          In the placid rain.
          That pleasing patter,
          An angel's heavenly song.
          
          Those joyful drops, skip and jump,
          On every window pane.
          Tumbling down excitedly on every leaf,
          Gently tapping the newborn buds.
          They water the ever-thirsty land,
          And the odyssey continues on and on.
          
          Unlucky ones, fall on the rooftop with splutter,
          Ending up in the dark drains and stinky gutter.
          
          Over the fields down the hills,
          On the rocky stones they slide.
          In a wild running stream,
          Enjoying the watery ride.
          
          They kiss down the cheeks,
          Of every bathing kid.
          Lingering in their lashes,
          Making them giggle.
          
          Seeping slowly through,
          The earth and soil.
          Returning to calm streams,
          And mystical rivers.
          
          Thundering down the hillside,
          Eroding through rocks and stones.
          Meandering slowly on the flat land,
          Depositing silt on the way.
          Exiting to the briny ocean.
          
          Then, summer dazzles with fun,
          Glittering pearls in the afterrain sun.
          Drops are taken back to the sky,
          With alacrity they notice, they're again able to fly.
          
          Recounting the events,
          Of the travails of their destiny.
          Of the lives they touched,
          In their insignificant journey.
          
          The tiny seeds and newborn buds,
          They'd touched softly, bloomed into full life.
          Now they realise, theirs wasn't a meaningless strife!
          
          They're God's creation,
          Worthless they can't be!
          They begin to believe in what they weren't told.
          That the almighty resides within them.

          On my way to the bottom,I was drowning,
          Into the depths of fathomless quiescence.
          My wretched heart was pounding,
          When I sensed a sophoric presence.
          
          Used to curse my hopeless life,
          Until you came around.
          That day when you held me,
          My world went upside down.
          
          You looked into my eyes,
          Made me believe in myself.
          And before that I swear,
          Never felt the need of help.
          
          Girl, just fall into me,
          I'll catch you darlin',
          We'll dance in the streets,
          When nobody's watchin.
          
          There'll be just you and me,
          Sheeran's song on repeat in our heads.
          How lucky your hair are!
          I'm even jealous of your threads.
          
          Collapse into me,
          Fall gallantly down,
          into my lap.
          Spring into my kiss,
          Imprison me between your lips.
          Let your soul blend into mine,
          Like the northern lights.
          Flood into my rhythm,
          Devour my love that lies within.
          
          Ripple your eyes,
          Draw that soft tone to my ear.
          Let me inhale your ethereality.
          Smother the fire within my heart.
          Cleanse me of my sins,
          By imparting that tantalizing smile.
          Wrap me tightly in your homely embrace,
          That even air don't get any space.
          
          I dissolve in thousands of moons,
          In the corner of longing, I sit every night.
          But in this world full of wonders,
          Your heart is all I need which I hold,
          To love and to be loved!

          You can tell me I'm insane, to think
          That we could have had it all

          That beautiful soul, no other matched.
          You were the warmth of the winter sun,
          That constant thought, that I couldn't outrun.
          
          From that very moment when we met,
          I could see colors in my palette.
          But now that the future's so unclear,
          I wonder if your feelings disappeared.
          
          Oh' Lemme tell,
          I'm in no kinda, 
          frame of mind,
          to let you go......
          
          Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
          I could use, 
          some of it, 
          to face tomorrows.
          'Cause I've, been so low, weighted under sorrows,
          By silhouettes of us, 
          I'm being followed.
          
          Oh' Why,
          Oh why don't you see!
          My lungs resist to breathe!
          While this heart hardly beats,
          Begging for some damn reprieve.
          And I can't believe,
          I can't believe,
          In any kinda life without you here!
          And I can't move on,
          'Cause it feels so wrong.
          No I just don't want any kinda life without you dear!
          
          Are there any words that I could say?
          It hurts how I've seen you slippin' away.
          With every passing golden hour, I lose some hope to the waves.
          And all of the memories that we shaped,
          I won't leave behind here in my wake.
          Whatever you've left, I'll hold on to it and wait.
          
          Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
          I could use, 
          some of it, 
          to face tomorrows.
          'Cause I've, been so low, weighted under sorrows,
          By silhouettes of us, 
          I'm being followed.
          
          Oh' Why,
          Oh why don't you see!
          My lungs resist to breathe!
          While this heart hardly beats,
          Begging for some damn reprieve.
          And I can't believe,
          I can't believe,
          In any kinda life without you here!
          And I can't move on,
          'Cause it feels so wrong.
          No I just don't want any kinda life without you dear!
          
          Now you're not here I can't explain,
          The carousel of my constant pain.
          Yet I'm sure that my love will last forevermore.
          Became a victim of circumstance,
          I lost you to this fuckin' distance.
          I don't want any kinda life without you here!

          <b>"Chal Diye Tum Kahan by AUR - cover"</b>

          Chal diye tum kahan pe,
          Kuch pal toh theher jaate.
          Raaston mein hi dil,
          Yeh beghar pada hai......
          
          Chal diye tum kahaan pe,
          Dekho paas aake,
          Aankhon se hi,
          Yeh dil ro raha hai......
          
          Tu aayi jaise koi saba,
          Aise chhuu ke guzar gayi.
          Roshni bhi mujhse haar,
          Bekhabar si ho gayi.
          
          Ek shaam teri hisse mein, 
          Maangi thi, woh magar,
          Mujhko mili, par tha
          Usme tera saaya bhi nahi.
          
          Ek umeed tujhse thi judi,
          Par aaya tu nahin,
          Khwaab tha mera to fir,
          Mujhe jagaya kyun nahin.
          
          Itne baeed se kyu rehte mujhse,
          Iski kya wajah hai,
          Maine to kabhi tumhara dil,
          Dukhaya hi nahi.
          
          Dil dukhaya jab nahin toh,
          Humse kaisa faasla.
          Tum jo keh do ghum ho jane ko, 
          Main ho jau'n fanaa.
          
          Tu kazib-e-khwab tha mera, 
          Yeh baat maan li.
          Jaaga khwaab se toh,
          Haqeeqat ne meri jaan li.
          
          Teri beetein raatein, 
          Aankhein teri moond-moond kar.
          Meri neend hoti puri aise boond-boond kar.
          Neendein bewafa aur raatein be-adab si ho gayi'n.
          Yaadein mujhse ishq karke, mujhme ghar hai kar gayi'n.
          
          Ke ab nahin hai khwaabon par yakeen,
          Tum bhi wo nahin ho aur hum bhi wo nahin,
          Fir kyon khal rahi hai teri woh kami
          Main to ro raha hoon, tu hai kyun nahin.
          
          Chal diye tum kahan pe,
          Kuch pal toh theher jaate.
          Raaston mein yeh dil,
          Tujhko dhunde pada hai.....
          
          Chal diye tum kahaan pe,
          Dekho ab toh aake,
          Aankhon se hi......
          Yeh dil ro raha hai.......
          
          Kamron mein akele hum toh,
          Waise hi milenge.
          Khwaab aankhon mein bas,
          Tere hi milenge.
          
          Tujhse dooriyan ho jitni bhi bhale,
          Hum tere hi the tere hi hain,
          Tere hi rahenge.
          
          Duaon se mangaye thay,
          Ke khwaab ho gye tum.
          Khwaab se jo utre,
          Tum jawaab ho gaye ho.
          
          Fir chal diye kahan,
          Aisa sawaal hai mera.
          Mujhe satane mein tum, 
          Lajawab ho gaye ho.
          
          Sochta tha tumko bhool jaunga yuhi,
          Par bhool bhool ke, tum meri yaad ho gaye ho.
          Jis gali se guzrein, humne tumko hi pukara,
          Fir pata chala ke hum tera makaan ho gye hain.
          
          Agar tumhein qubool hai,
          Yeh ghar ki zimmedari,
          Khud mein panah dedenge,
          Aake dastakein toh do.
          
          Likh main daalunga meri sabhi kahaaniya'n,
          Mere saath hui woh saari be-imaaniyaa'n.
          Kis tarah se kat rahi hai,
          Mujh par kya guzar rahi hai,
          Tumne jaana hi nahin hai kabhi jaane ja.
          
          Ab tum yaad aa rahe ho,
          Behisaab aa rahe ho,
          Door khade ho kar,
          Muskuraye ja rhe ho.
          
          Is qadar bhi berukhi,
          Koi karta hai bhala,
          Meri jaan ja rahi hai,
          Tum kahaan ja rahe ho.
          
          Aansu sookh se gaye hain,
          Aankhein pyaas se bhari hain.
          Tasveeron se teri kab se,
          Baat kar rahi hain,
          Dhadkane bhi ab yahi pukarti hain,
          Aa jao aa jao.
          
          Chal diye tum kahaan pe,
          Aajao yahaan pe.
          Raaston mein hi...
          Dil kho gaya hai.
          
          Chal diye tum kahaan pe,
          Dekho na muskura ke,
          Aankhon se hi...
          yeh dil beh gaya hai...

          To kya nazar chura lu'n ..?
          Ya dekhta hi rahoon?

          Sochta na rahoon..
          
          Log kehte hain paa-gal,
          Hoon main yeh bhi naa jaanoo'n.
          Dil lutaaya hai maine,
          Ab kisi ki na maanoo'n.
          
          Chain dekar ke maine, 
          Bechainiyaa'n yeh li hain.
          Neendei'n udaa ke maine,
          Unse wafayein ki hain.

          Hum unko waqt rehte.
          Bezaar rahon par hum,

          Kuch ishaaro'n mein unse,
          Unse jo yeh suna hai. 
          Nasamjhi kar gaya main,
          Naadan-e-dil laga kar.
          
          Jab unko dekhte hain,

          <b>"Idea of Her by Ali Gatie - cover"</b>

          She was the one,
          Who took out the numb, 
          in me.
          
          She made them run, 
          My demons gone, 
          I couldn't count to three.
          
          She gave me something,
          Something to believe in.
          
          After so long, 
          I caught a breath, 
          It was so relieving.
          
          My sleepless nights,
          My fear of heights, 
          They said "We're leaving."
          
          She was my one drug,
          She could fix all my lows.
          
          She gave me highs all the time, 
          Sometimes out of control.
          
          
          She was the second chance, 
          I gave to the cupid.
          He kicked my ass, 
          I'm torn apart,
          Left feeling stupid.
          
          I shut my eyes, reminisce
          I was fine in the abyss
          I remember back when life was a curse.
          I forced myself to believe,
          That she was perfect for me.
          
          There I fell in love, 
          With the idea of her.
          
          It takes,
          One look in her eyes, 
          She could build,
          Truth out of lies.
          
          I was in love,
          With the idea of her.
          
          I was obsessed, 
          With the idea of her.
          
          
          
          Lied to myself,
          Ghosted all the warnings.
          I knew what it was,
          I was starting to fear the cold wind she was blowing....
          Now that I realize
          I wasn't ready for it
          I take the blame
          I tried to love the narcissist that she was.
          
          I shut my eyes and I think,
          She stabbed my soul, didn't flinch.
          I miss back when I was a flightless bird.
          I forced myself, took the leap.
          She would catch, I believed.
          
          I fell in love,
          With the idea of her
          
          It takes,
          One word in her voice. 
          She could turn,
          hearts into toys.
          
          
          I was in love,
          With the idea of her. 
          
          I fell in love,
          With the idea of her
          
          I open my eyes and I scream,
          Saw what I hated to see.
          I was better back when life was a blur
          It was a mistake to believe,
          That she was perfect for me.
          
          I fell in love,
          With the idea of her
          I fell in love,
          With the idea of her
